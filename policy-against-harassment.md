## Policy Against Harassment

It is extremely important to the FaaCT organizing team that all presenters and attendees have access to a safe and inclusive conference space in order to participate fully and contribute to this vast interdisciplinary research community. We have developed a variety of systems to limit high-level access and reduce harassment during the conference. Still, no platform is perfect and we want to respond both proactively and reactively.

To facilitate an environment that promotes respect, shared learning and collaboration, we request that all participants abide by the following guidelines:
* Exercise‭ ‬consideration‭ ‬and‭ ‬respect‭ ‬in‭ ‬your‭ ‬speech‭ ‬and‭ ‬actions;‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬
* Refrain‭ ‬from‭ ‬demeaning,‭ ‬discriminatory,‭ ‬or‭ ‬harassing‭ ‬behavior‭ ‬and‭ ‬speech;‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬
* Be mindful of your fellow participants and do not imply that there things that everybody should know;

In attending the FAccT conference, participants abide by [ACM's Policy Against Harassment at ACM Activities](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment) and the [ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment) and agree that behavior which deviates from these guidelines will constitute grounds for actions against any attendee. If you are involved in or witness any such incident, please [submit a complaint to the organizing team](https://forms.gle/5oRUK4mytAx1riMJ6) and the members of the Safety and Inclusion team will review the case.

If a complaint is submitted to the conference, the case will be reviewed by the conference’s Safety and Inclusion Panel. The panel will be composed of three of the following: 1) Conference General Chair, 2) Conference Executive Committee Member, 3) Diversity and Inclusion Chair, 4) Virtual Experience Chair. The panel will convene to review a complaint as soon as feasible and decide based on the code of conduct policies and available or relevant evidence appropriate disciplinary action which can include but not limited to partial or full dismissal from the conference. Regardless of the enforcement decision, the panel should encourage all submitters to [complete a confidential complaint to ACM](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_VrrqbwhjfGkSzd3hUgESaRoVDYUowiR-7bopeNnhoE/edit#heading=h.v1zdsdgto5qc).
