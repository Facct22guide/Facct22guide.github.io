## Agenda and Breakout Instructions

### Session 1: Research Discussions
Time: 4:15–5:00

In this 45-minute session you will be in breakout groups of 4-5 people. Begin by going around and briefly introducing yourselves. Then, each person should talk (without slides) for ~5 minutes on the primary topics of their research and open questions for next steps on their dissertation. This will be followed by ~5 minutes of questions and discussion about that person’s project. Any remaining time after everyone has had a chance to present can be spent in broader discussions about the topics raised by everyone’s projects. 


### Session 2: Topical Discussions
Time: 5:05–5:50

This session presents an opportunity for you to self-select into topical discussions relevant to their work and their careers. At the start of the session, you can self-select into the breakout room of your choice. The topics provide a rough focus area for your discussion. We recommend starting by going around, introducing yourself, and describing what connection to or interest you have in that room. After ~20 minutes, we will broadcast a suggestion (not a requirement) to consider switching rooms if there is another topic you would like to discuss. 

### Session 3: Mentoring
Time: 6:00–6:55
(Session 3A: 6:00–6:35; Session 3B: 6:35–6:55)

In Session 3A, groups of 3-4 students will be paired with mentors in fields related to FAccT, with the opportunity to ask questions about research directions and career trajectories. Each student should briefly introduce themselves, describing the primary focus of their research and the primary questions or topics they would like to discuss in this session. The group mentor can then moderate a discussion about the topics that were raised and any subsequent questions that arise. After 30 minutes, we will ask groups to pair up for Session 3B. This will give groups a chance to have further conversation about the topics they have been discussing and to compare the experiences and perspectives of the two mentors.
