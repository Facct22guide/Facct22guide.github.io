## Background

The countdown to ACM FAccT 2021 has begun! The conference will be held as a completely virtual conference March 4 - 10, 2021. It is our hope that we can invite some of the same curiosity and engaged participation that has defined the previous four years.

The conference brings together researchers and practitioners interested in fairness, accountability, and transparency in socio-technical systems. This is our first conference under the new name, and still builds on the success of the 2020 conference held in Barcelona. This year we are featuring 17 Tutorial sessions, 11 CRAFT sessions, 26 Paper-focused sessions, 3 Keynotes and a lot more. It is our hope that, whether you are new or seasoned alumni, you walk away feeling connected and excited about the work happening in this multidisciplinary research community.

This Guide contains key dates, information about registration, conference tech set-up, and instructions on how to get support before the event.
