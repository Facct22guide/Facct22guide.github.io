## How to Prepare for the Program
The majority of FAccT 2021 occurs on the conference hub. The hub is a custom platform that contains most of the tools you will need to participate in FaaCT 2021. As a registered attendee you will have access to the hub starting on Friday, February 26. We recommend you take some time to familiarize yourself with the space and encourage you to engage with speakers and attendees before the conference begins in our Community space.

During the conference, you will explore the hub to watch the sessions, learn about speakers, download papers, and discuss relevant topics with your fellow conference attendees. All you need is a browser, an internet connection, and conference registration on the hub.
