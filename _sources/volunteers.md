## F.A.Q.

```{dropdown} How do I start an in-person session volunteer shift?

For in person sessions, please check in on the volunteer slack channel at the start of your session so that we know youâ€™re ready. Approximately 15 minutes before the start of the sessions, please go to the conference room where the session will take place and inform the session chair you are present.

If we only hear from the backup and not the assigned volunteer at 15 minutes before the session goes live, weâ€™ll direct the backup to support the event.

```

```{dropdown} How do I start an online volunteer shift?

For online sessions, please check in on the volunteer slack channel at the start of your session so that we know youâ€™re ready. Approximately 15 minutes before the start of the sessions, please go to Hopin, locate the session you are supporting and inform the session chair you are present.

If we only hear from the backup and not the assigned volunteer at 15 minutes before the session goes live, weâ€™ll direct the backup to join the meeting.

```

```{dropdown}  How Do I start a Backup shift?

Please check in on the volunteer slack channel at the start of your paper session so that we know youâ€™re ready.

If we only hear from the backup and not the assigned volunteer, 15 minutes before the session goes live, weâ€™ll provide an online link for the backup volunteer to join the meeting, or inform the in-person volunteer about the session logistics they should support.

```

```{dropdown}  What are volunteers be responsible for?

Volunteers are there to support the session chair and session presenters with technical and lightweight facilitation support. Online Volunteers should be comfortable with Hopin & Zoom. The exact role will depend on the shift you choose and what the organizers need.

```

```{dropdown} How can I get trained to use the conference digital tools?

Contact volunteers@facctconference.org to ask for the video recording of the tech rehearsal.

This depends on the type of support. We have a large team that includes an events team, Chairs depending on the type of session, and more.
* For technical issues during the conference (trouble connecting, etc.), please seek support via the Support chat box on the conference portal.
* If you have other questions and donâ€™t know who to contact, write to the [Volunteers Slack channel here](https://join.slack.com/share/enQtMzU0ODAwNDE3MTQ3Ni1hMmJjZDIyMTUwYjNmM2RhMjg5Mzg3MDU3MGQ2ZWRiMGVkNWE1N2I2ODg0NzViODk2ZjBjNzUyNjVhZjkzOTk1).

```

```{dropdown} What does a Hopin ambassador do?**

A Hopin ambassador should hang out in the virtual rooms and engage with other attendees by: 1) asking questions, 2) responding to messages, 3) starting conversations to encourage members to get to know each other, 4) reporting inappropriate (guidelines about moderation will follow). For individuals that are attending the conference online, we need to be more intentional in order to build the network during the event.

On Hopin, staff recommends:

ðŸ—£ Engage, provide support and be accessible. Donâ€™t leave your members hanging! Be accessible. Communities are about interaction, and it starts with you. If you are unresponsive, expect others to follow your lead. See questions that only you can answer? Jump in - or empower others to help out! Read what your members are posting, like and comment on their topics, too. Remember, every post is an opportunity to get to know your members and empower them to succeed.

ðŸ’¡ QUICK TIP Although itâ€™s crucial that you engage, try not to dominate every conversation. You want to give others an opportunity to shine! Help kickstart the discussion, but once you get the conversation flowing itâ€™s time to let your members continue to chat on their own.

```

```{dropdown} What does a social media ambassador do?

 Social media volunteers will be asked to translate content about the conference to other languages besides English, so that it can be posted on social media.

```

```{dropdown} What does an online doctoral colloquium volunteer do?

The Doctoral Colloquium (DC) volunteer will manage Host responsibilities for the Zoom Meeting, send the groups into breakout sessions at specific times, and call attendees back from breakouts. The Volunteer should have familiarity with Zoom host tools and support the DC chairs if technical issues arise.

```

```{dropdown} What does an in person session volunteer do?

Paper session volunteers will work with Session Chairs to ensure that technical logistics run smoothly. Volunteers will be responsible for mic issues, assist the presenters with slide support, and any other issue that might arise. 

Given the nature of the session (paper/tutorial/CRAFT) specific tasks might be requested, that will be known in advance. 

```

```{dropdown} What does an online session volunteer do?

An online session volunteer will help [managing](https://support.hopin.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059612552-How-to-use-the-StreamYard-Backstage-within-Hopin) the Hopin system (tech support) for the program. They should be able to manage the screen layout and control the participants screen, according to the session chairs remarks. They will also provide presents with an appropriate â€œbackstageâ€™ link to the presenters (more information will follow).

For CRAFTs & Tutorials, additional support might be needed (e.g. zoom moderation, etc.). Session chairs will inform volunteers in advance of this.

```

```{dropdown} What does a keynote/thematic panel volunteer do?

Keynotes and Thematic Panels are moderated and require little support, but we figured it would make sense to have a volunteer available in case we needed their help with something on-the-fly.

```

```{dropdown} What does a Shift Coordinator do?

A Shift Coordinator is responsible for ensuring that there is a volunteer at each slot for a specific shift. They monitor slack to get feedback from volunteers about the shifts, and assign backup individuals in case that someone does not show up. Furthermore in person shift coordinators support the conference with further tasks such as COVID Testing information, etc. 

```
