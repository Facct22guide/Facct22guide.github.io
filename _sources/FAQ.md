# FAQ

```{dropdown} What software do I need for the conference?

You will only need a web browser for the majority of the conference. We recommend Chrome, though our conference hub works on Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge as well.

For a few of the more interactive sessions during the conference (such as the Doctoral Colloquium), you will also need access to Zoom. Be sure to [download the Zoom desktop application](https://zoom.us/download) ahead of time.

```{dropdown} What accounts do I need to create to access the conference?

After registering for the conference, your conference hub and circle.so accounts will automatically be created for you. You will receive your login credentials via email and do not need to create any additional accounts to access the conference.

The only exception is for interactive sessions (such as the Doctoral Colloquium) where Zoom will be used. For these sessions, you will know ahead of time whether you need Zoom access, and you will need a Zoom account to access them (a free account is fine).

```{dropdown} Why is the conference not using Gather?


We explored using Gather and we were excited to be able to provide an opportunity for engagement like the hallway conversations and running into people coincidentally that we miss from in person conferences.  However, Gather has poor accessibility for disabled people, especially blind, low vision, deaf and hard of hearing participants. UbiComp / ISWC 2020 recommended to other ACM conferences that Gather.town NOT be used in the future  unless accessibility issues are addressed. We investigated workarounds and asked Gather about their current accessibility but we were not able to provide a good experience.

We do want to acknowledge that in other ways online conferences are more accessible, so we have worked hard to create other ways for people to engage.

```{dropdown} I can't sign in to the conference hub, who should I contact?

If you recently registered (in the last few hours or so), your account may not have been created on the conference hub just yet. New accounts are created periodically, and you will receive an email with your login credentials once your account has been created on the hub website.

If you have not received an email after a few hours, you can contact registration support by sending them an email at facctregistration@executivevents.com. They will be able to help add you to the system and manually send you your login credentials. 

You may also visit the [conference hub](https://2021.facctconference.org/) and use the `Support` link on the left. 
```

```{dropdown} What is my login information for circle.so?

You should log into the [conference hub](https://2021.facctconference.org/) and select community. It is the same as your conference hub credentials.
