## Diversity & Inclusion Chairs
One of the key strategic goals of the ACM FAccT Conference is promoting diversity and inclusion. The work of the ACM FAccT Diversity & Inclusion Chairs is to help achieve this goal by working closely with all of the conference organizers, including the General Chairs, Program Committee Chairs, and Executive Committee. Diversity & Inclusion Chairs may serve two two-year terms.

### Current Members

## Sponsorship Chairs

One key tactic for achieving the diversity and inclusion goals of the ACM FAccT Conference is keeping registration costs very low, so that cost is not a hardship for those wishing to attend. The work of the ACM FAccT Sponsorship Chairs is to raise funds that can be used to offset conference costs and provide grants for conference attendees. They are responsible for cultivating new sponsors and maintaining relationships with existing sponsors. Furthermore, the Sponsorship Chairs are responsible for ensuring that new sponsors align with the strategic vision laid out in the Strategic Plan, and for communicating conference policy with sponsors. Sponsorship Chairs may serve two two-year terms.
