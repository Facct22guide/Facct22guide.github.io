# Community Agreements

__Welcome to the ACM FAccT 2021 online conference!__

Please review the following community agreements before joining the conference. These agreements reflect the values of our community and are designed to foster inclusive and respectful interaction. They are adapted from [Allied Media Conference’s community agreements](https://amc.alliedmedia.org/how-to-virtual-amc/community-agreements).

- __A safe and inclusive conference space is our priority.__
  - Participants must abide by [ACM's Policy Against Harassment at ACM Activities](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment) and the [ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment) and agree that behavior which deviates from these guidelines will constitute grounds for actions against any attendee.  
  - If you are involved in or witness any such incident, please submit a [complaint to the conference organizers](https://forms.gle/5oRUK4mytAx1riMJ6) and the members of the Safety and Inclusion team will review the case.
- __Respect fellow participants and scholars.__ Refrain‭ ‬from‭ ‬demeaning,‭ ‬discriminatory,‭ ‬or‭ ‬harassing‭ ‬behavior‭ ‬and‭ ‬speech‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬.

- __Practice explicit affirmative verbal consent.__ Do not record or screenshot any session without notification and consent.

- __Understand that there are a wide variety of ways that people communicate, process information, and express themselves.__ Exercise‭ ‬consideration‭ ‬and‭ ‬respect‭ ‬in‭ ‬your‭ ‬speech‭ ‬and‭ ‬action‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬.

- __Ask questions before assuming.__ The best way to understand the choices, actions, or intentions of one another is by asking.

- __No one knows everything; together we know a lot.__
  - In any conversation, especially ones about systemic power (race, class, gender, etc), we know that each person is coming to the conversation with different levels of lived experience and embodied expertise. We also believe that each person has something to contribute to the conversation. This agreement asks that we all practice being humble, and look for what we have to learn from each person in the room. It asks us to share what we know, as well as our questions, so that others may learn from us.

- __Ask for clarification. No question is a bad question.__ Be mindful of your fellow participants and do not imply that there things that everybody should know;

- __Calling in instead of calling out.__ Whenever appropriate, try contacting someone directly to voice your grievances, criticisms, or concerns about their speech or actions before denouncing them publicly.
  - If you are involved in or witness harassment or behavior that deviates from these community guidelines, please submit a [complaint to the conference organizers](https://forms.gle/5oRUK4mytAx1riMJ6) and the members of the Safety and Inclusion team will review the case.

- __Stay flexible and patient__ around any technology needs, changes, cancellations or schedule shifts throughout the conference. We are doing this for the very first time!

- If you need something at the conference, ask for it!
