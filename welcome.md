# Welcome to the FAcct21 Guide

Welcome to the FAccT 21 Conference Guide.  This handbook to the conference should
help provide any additional information about how things are going to go. We have
worked hard over the past several months to make a thoughtful equitable and
engaging online experience for attendees at FAccT21 and one of the most important
features of that process for us is to create transparent documentation of all
of the things that we have planned.  We hope that the conference site is easy to
navigate but know that there are somethings that are best with some extra guidelines.

This handbook also includes information about the processes for session chairs,
authors, and volunteers.

Further, we've released this as [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) so it is free for others to use.


Sincerely,

Sarah Brown
Virtual Experience Chair
